# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?
## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 
If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. 
How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. 
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. 

## History

- **1991:** Python was first introduced by Guido van Rossum.
- **2000s:** Python 2.x series gained popularity, leading to widespread adoption.
- **2008:** Python 3 was released with improvements and backward-incompatible changes.
- **Present:** Python 3 is the dominant version, and Python continues to evolve with regular releases.


## Usage

Python is used in a wide range of applications, including:

- **Web Development:** Frameworks like Django and Flask.
- **Data Science and Machine Learning:** Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
- **Automation and Scripting:** Automating tasks and writing scripts.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Natural language processing and computer vision applications.
- **Game Development:** Pygame and other libraries.
- **Network Programming:** Creating networked applications.

## Features

### 1. Readability

Python emphasizes code readability, making it easier for developers to write and maintain code.

### 2. Simplicity

The language's syntax is simple and expressive, reducing the cost of program maintenance.

### 3. Versatility

Python supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, allowing developers to choose the paradigm that suits their needs.

### 4. Extensive Libraries

A vast standard library and a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries simplify development and reduce the need for reinventing the wheel.

### 5. Community Support

The Python community is large and active, contributing to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and support forums.

## Advantages

- **Productivity:** Python's simplicity and readability lead to faster development cycles.
- **Community:** Access to a large community of developers provides support and resources.
- **Libraries:** Extensive standard and third-party libraries simplify complex tasks.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for a wide range of applications and domains.
- **Interpretation:** Python is an interpreted language, allowing for rapid prototyping and development.

## Conclusion

Python's elegance, readability, and versatility make it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Whether you're building web applications, analyzing data, or working on AI projects, Python's strengths contribute to its continued success in the programming landscape.
