## For loop in Python

In Python, a for loop is a control flow statement that iterates over a sequence of elements, executing a block of code for each element in the sequence. The syntax for a for loop in Python is:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code block to be executed for each item
```
Here, item is a variable that takes the value of each element in the sequence during each iteration, and sequence is the collection of elements over which the loop iterates.

The sequence can be any iterable object in Python, such as `lists`, `tuples`, `strings`, `dictionaries`, `sets`, and more. Essentially, if an object can be iterated over, it can be used in a for loop.

Here are a few examples:

## 1. Iterating over a list:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
## 2. Iterating over a string:
```python
message = "Hello, world!"
for char in message:
    print(char)
```
## 3. Iterating over a dictionary (keys, values, or both):
```python
student_grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92, "Charlie": 78}
for name, grade in student_grades.items():
    print(name, ":", grade)
```
## 4. Iterating over a range:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
### Range() function in python
In Python, the range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. It's commonly used in conjunction with for loops to iterate a specific number of times or to generate a series of numbers.

The range() function can take one, two, or three arguments, with the general syntax being:

```python
range(start, stop, step)
```
- `start` (optional): The starting value of the sequence. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
- `stop` (required): The end value of the sequence. The sequence generated will not include this value.
- `step` (optional): The step size or increment by which the sequence will be generated. If omitted, it defaults to 1.
When only one argument is provided, range(stop), it generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to stop - 1 with a step size of 1.
