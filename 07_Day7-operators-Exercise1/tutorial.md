# Day 7 Operators in Python

Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. They are fundamental components of any programming language and play a crucial role in performing various tasks.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used for mathematical calculations.

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)
- `**` : Exponentiation
- `//` : Floor Division (quotient)

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `<` : Less than
- `>` : Greater than
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations.

- `and` : Logical AND
- `or` : Logical OR
- `not` : Logical NOT

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=` : Assigns a value to a variable
- `+=` : Adds and assigns
- `-=` : Subtracts and assigns
- `*=` : Multiplies and assigns
- `/=` : Divides and assigns
- `%=` : Modulus and assigns
- `**=` : Exponentiates and assigns
- `//=` : Floor divides and assigns

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

- `&` : Bitwise AND
- `|` : Bitwise OR
- `^` : Bitwise XOR
- `~` : Bitwise NOT
- `<<` : Left shift
- `>>` : Right shift

## Membership Operators

Membership operators test whether a value is a member of a sequence.

- `in` : Returns True if a value is found in the sequence
- `not in` : Returns True if a value is not found in the sequence

## Identity Operators

Identity operators compare the memory addresses of two objects.

- `is` : Returns True if both variables point to the same object
- `is not` : Returns True if both variables point to different objects
